Predictix (Application Developer) Technical Screening

We prize programming prowess in this role. As a way of demonstrating their skills, we ask
candidates to spend no more than one hour preparing responses to three programming problems.
We do not expect industrial strength code, but do look for a solution that is responsive to the
problem.

1. Write a function or sub-routine in your favorite programming language which, when
given a list of integers will return the largest sum of contiguous integers in the list. For
example, if the input is (-10, 2, 3, -2, 5, -15), the function will return 8.

2. Write a function or sub-routine in your favorite programming language that will read in
an arbitrary English text file as input, parse it into words, and print the count for each
word. For example, if the file contained ‘la tee da tee da’, then the function would print:
la – 1
tee – 2
da – 2

3. Design a set of data structures to be used to implement a solitaire game such as Solitaire,
FreeCell, or Spider Solitaire. Provide the implementation either using your favorite
programming language or SQL. The implementation should provide the data, public
method interface and descriptions, but does not need to provide implementations of the
methods.
